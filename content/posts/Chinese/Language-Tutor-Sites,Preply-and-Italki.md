I wanted to learn conversational Chinese by having a language tutor. I chose Preply (*is it pronounced Pre-Ply or Prep-ly?*) for that since that was the first website that came straight when I google *"language tutor"*. 

I started on March 2023 and decided I wanted to take a break for a short while in early October 2023.

Anyways.., I get that you would want the highest bang for your buck as a student. The teacher would also like to have as much take-home pay minus the commission as possible according to their qualification as a tutor respectively. 

But the amount of money tutors get commissioned off on Preply is absolutely criminal compared to other sites and this is **why I won't join Preply anymore**

There is a lot of reviews already on the Internet about Preply such as [here](https://happilyevertravels.com/preply-vs-italki/), and [here](https://academichelp.net/language-learning-websites/preply-review.html). But, I am going to only talk about the business side of the website. 

# Trial lessons

Firstly, trial lessons meaning the first time a student learns with a new teacher. [Preply charges **100%** of the cost of trial lessons to tutors](https://help.preply.com/en/articles/4171348-when-and-how-will-i-get-paid-for-lessons). Meaning, no money whatsoever for trial lessons. This is smart and also scammy from Preply since they know that tutors must have trial lessons in the first place to attract students. 

For comparison sake, [Italki charges **nothing** for trial lessons](https://support.italki.com/hc/en-us/articles/206352068-How-does-italki-charge-a-commission-#:~:text=When%20a%20lesson%20or%20package,the%20teacher%27s%20listed%20lesson%20price.). A complete 180. As a consequence of charging full cost of trial lessons. Teachers in Preply often just does not show-up as mentioned [here](https://happilyevertravels.com/preply-vs-italki/). 

Luckily, I didn't encounter this kind of problem and gotten a good Mandarin tutor.

Preply did state however the reason for this 100% commission rate shown above taken from [here](https://help.preply.com/en/articles/4171383-preply-commission-model). 

To me, it is more of a student-oriented commission model. Saying that trial lesson is more of a planning phase. Fair. That is pretty reasonable. 

But, for a student-oriented approach, I would think its more reasonable to have quality teachers, and with quality teachers comes more teacher-oriented commission model.

Planning phase, to me atleast a fairly intermediate Chinese level speaker would like it to be discussed during text. Since, I prefer speaking no English at all from the start with all the confusion with it. 

I prefer ITalki trial lesson plan better. The teacher sets it up to how low and how high, giving lots of flexibility and competitive edge but also give students a better understanding of why certain teachers has high trial lesson plan. 

# Commission Rate

Comparing the two tables, clearly ITalki is more beneficial across the board. It doesnt matter how many hours you ticked, ITalki still has a lower commission rate for teachers. A side effect to this, there will be less profit for ITalki, but Preply even with all these higher commission is [still not profitable?](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/19/ukrainian-founded-preply-bags-70-million-for-ai-assisted-language-app.html#)] while [earning three times more than ITalki?](https://growjo.com/company/italki)


# Summary

Well Im transferring myself to ITalki because I prefer to pay my teachers a reasonable price. As much as it is, learning language is a connection between me and the teacher.
