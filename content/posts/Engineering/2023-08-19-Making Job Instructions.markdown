When I was making ***Job Instructions (JI)*** for assembling, it feels like sometimes there are pieces of things that I felt needed to be inputted into it.

But first ...

Why make job instructions?

This is much because of ISO 9001 that is pretty prestigious in that it requires a company that has paid for ISO 9001 certification to be more professional and easier to get customers to do business with them. Part of the requirement in being part of the ISO 9001 [is having to have job instructions for every assembly](https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html)

For a company that focuses on mostly human-based assembling a product for a customer, labour time takes up a significant cost.

How to make good job instructions?

## Why Make Good Job Instructions In The First Place
### 1. Save Labour Time 
For a company that has a factory that requires human-assembled product, or a company that specialises in assembling and manufacturing various customer products. **Labour time would takes up a significant cost for these type of companies**. A JI can take a massive difference since assemblers would know procedures much faster.

The fastest labour time is ones that they remember from start to finish. No need to look up at JIs or face any difficulty in the process since they already know what to do (like robots). However, I think its too idealistic to have people remember from start to finish. 

Having a good JI atleast can guide people to the correct assembly. The problem is when the JI's are itself problematic and can either confuse with hard to interpret sentences and have them asking more questions.

### 2. Avoid Mistakes

Small mistakes made during assembling such as forgotting to put a certain screw on a bracket before installing another bracket that completely prevents the other forgotten bracket to be installed can consume a lot of the labour time especially after you have gone deep into the procedure and have to dissasemble back to just install the bracket you forgot earlier. **These mistakes could really be big time waster especially if your making big batches of units at once and forgot to install it for all of the units**.

### 3. Easier To Train New People

## Some Terms to Know

{{< myimage src="Example_SOP.svg" scale="100" id="ExampleSOP" caption="Example Flowchart of SOP" style="transform: scale(0.1)" > }}

<img> 

* SOP (Standard Operating Procedures)
  * Broad
  * Include multiple departments. 
    * For example, Sales and Engineering or Electrical Assembly and Mechanical Assembly
  * Provide general steps for a company to reach a certain goal
    * For example, process flow shown in [](#ExampleSOP)
* Assembly / Manufacturing Job Instructions (JI)
  * Specific
  * For the assemblers themself
    * For example, "Insert wheel onto location shown"



## How I Approached Making Good Instruction Procedures

There are a lot of videos on Youtube and articles about making good job instruction such as [here](https://4industry.com/manufacturing-glossary/digital-work-instructions-a-complete-guide/).

But I want to emphasize that I am basing my definition Good Instruction to ***Good Assembly Instruction*** that are used daily by assemblers. Sort of like making instructions for IKEA DIY instructions.

### 1. More Pictures, Less Words

The things I noticed is that **nobody**, even me reads words when assembling a product. When making Job Instructions, it has to be with being in an assemblers mind because an Engineer have completely different backgrounds to an assemblers. They might be able to understand technical jargon more. They might read a lot more than assemblers so they can be driven for more wordy job instructions. 

Having more words might actually delay assembling time longer since it requires a lot more time to read words of a sentence than glance on a picture.

{% include image.html name='FirstThingYouReadIsPicture.png' cap='Example of confusing instruction DO NOT DO LIKE THIS' class='imgright' size=30 id='ExampleBadPic' %}

Looking at [](#ExampleBadPic), there are several problems with it. 
First, there are too many words. Imagine not looking at the photo at all. The first sentence, would already make you so confused. Where is the hole? What is cord grip? What does it look like? What is a power cord? What does it look like? How do you fit it in the first place?. These are the questions that I would ask if I start assembling this product for the first time. Heck, even If I made it before and coming back to it later, I would still might have to ask these questions. 

Second, the image. Its a bit crowded to my liking. Eventhough, it solves a lot of problems with just putting on sentences, cramping too much info might cause a loss of detail that assemblers might miss on. 

Also, the correlation between the mini pictures and two main pictures might be lost to where its suppose to fit in. For example, the **WD-40 silicone spray** looking at first glance, you might be thinking where is it supposed to be placed? the cord grip?, where in the cord grip?. 

From an assembler perspective, the words would be *maybe* read at first but then they would just look at the photo most of the time. Also, there get overwhelm with the massive info in the photo and would ask themselves, *where do I start? which textbox correlates to which part in the photo?* Its a jumble mess.

My way in fixing this is by:
* Break the pictures into parts:
  * Cord Grip and Power Cord installation
  * Fit the Earth Screw with the screw diagram as shown
  * Fit the switch with the rivet and the cable termination

Therefore, having a total of 3 separate pictures has clear processes in steps. You can also use the same photo but crop out to center the part that you want to emphasize in. 

### 2. Good Point of View (POV)

{{< myimage src="GENERAL_POV2.jpg" scale="100" id="back_view_chassis"  caption='Back View' >}}

{{< myimage src="GENERAL_POV1.jpg" scale="100" id="front_view_chassis"  caption='Front View' >}}

The picture point of view should always be into what the assemblers point of view. Its a good way for them to compare the picture (which would be the ideal assembly) and their own assembly. In this case, [The Front View](#front_view_chassis) has the point of view as the assembler.

Different point of view such as [](#back_view_chassis) would have the assembler image in their mind how the product should be like or rotated based on the image. Its a subtle difference but could avoid any confusion on the matter.

<div class='clear-right'></div>

{{< myimage src="POV_NOTCLEAR.jpg" scale="100" id="pov1"  caption='A different POV' >}}

{{< myimage src="Picture3.jpg" scale="100" id="pov2"  caption='Another detailed POV' >}}


[POV 1](#pov1) is acceptable in terms of assemblers POV since they would be looking back and forth between the front and back side of panel as shown. But the image itself might not be clear anymore to be referred to. For example, if you are trying to describe in which side the switch (if it has an asymmetric shape) to put onto the chassis, you might have a problem its not clear enough!.

Lets look at [POV 2](#pov2), rather than a POV from the side like [POV 1](#pov1). A POV from the top would be pretty ideal since this is basically the assemblers POV the whole time. They are looking from top to bottom. You can clearly see the shape of the switch now at its proper position. This solves the problem in [POV 1](#pov1). However, there is another problem lurking which is the connection of the two brown cables to the switch is not visible. 


<div class='clear-right'></div>

{{< myimage src="POV.jpg" scale="100" id="pov3"  caption='Another POV' >}}

To fix the problem from [POV](#pov2) and [](#pov1), a more closer picture can be shown that shows the connections of the switch as shown in [](#pov3). The photo is taken in a way that an assembler can still have a POV similar to the picture but also close enough to show details in this step of the assembly procedure.


### 3. Summary Photo


{{< myimage src="Quick_Batch_Making_Page.png" scale="100" id="SummaryPhoto"  caption='A summarized photo of sub-assembly' >}}

For complete assemblies such as the ones you have to make from start to finish product, making a sub-assembly in batches is more efficient in terms of assembly performance. When making batches, its important to not make miss any assembly steps in making the sub assembly, since this can potentially cause having to disassemble the whole batch again just to fit the missed step. This is a big time waster and reworking is always a time waster. With this in mind, after making a step-by-step assembly procedure of a certain sub-assembly, having a summary photo and a sub-assembly end result would be really good in preventing this problem as shown in [](#SummaryPhoto).

<div class='clear-right'></div>


{{< myimage src="Separate_Prep_AND_FINAL.png" scale="100" id="batchMoffat"  caption='BatchMaking' >}}

{{< myimage src="After_Prep_Drawing.png" scale="100" id="drawingMoffat"  caption='Snapshot Wiring Diagram for full assembled product' >}}


For much simpler batch making as in [](#batchMoffat), the simpler one page approach would actually be significantly more helpful than step-by-step procedures for each pictures. This would prepare the assembler for each part of the component before reaching the final assembly to compile all components together into a single completed product. 

This way, its clearer to know the most efficient assembly style compared to just looking at a wiring diagram as in [](#drawingMoffat). 

## From the Sources

There was not any much sources to really specifically show example photo based like I did from above. However, there was some interesting sources that I wanted to share that I found which will be valuable in making assembly instructions that are easy to understand and follow.

### 1. Designing Effective Step-by-Step Assembly Instructions

From [*Agrawala, Maneesh & Phan, Doantam & Heiser, Julie & Haymaker, John & Klingner, Jeff & Hanrahan, Pat & Tversky, Barbara. (2003). Designing effective step-by-step assembly instructions. ACM Trans. Graph.. 22. 828-837. 10.1145/882262.882352.*](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/assembly_instructions/assembly.pdf)

* People prefer instructions that has assembly operations across sequence of diagrams rather than single diagram with all operations
* One Diagram for one step, multiple diagrams in one step can be tedious
  * This one diagram must provide enough information for the steps (meaning example from above, the markers in the switches for cable termination)
* New Parts added must be visible in its whole, earlier parts attached should also be in the photo and this is to provide context (such as where is the new part positioned relative to the earlier part). However, if there is no need to have context, than only the new part can be visible only.

While reading this paper, I noticed that the type of person that they are focusing on when making these assembly procedure principles is actually directed to one-time assemblers like DIY IKEA or making your own bicycle. Eventhough the principle still applies, it did not take account Quality Assurance of assembly procedure and methods to prevent that. 

### 2. Folding a fish, making a mushroom: The role of diagrams in executing assembly procedures

From [Novick, L.R., Morse, D.L. Folding a fish, making a mushroom: The role of diagrams in executing assembly procedures. Memory & Cognition 28, 1242–1256 (2000). https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03211824](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/bf03211824)

* People can reason and link about two different objects with diagrams and pictures rather than just words.
  * An interesting reading is [Mayer, Bove, Bryman, Mars, and Tapangco (1996)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232425359_When_Less_is_More_Meaningful_Learning_from_Visual_and_Verbal_Summaries_of_Science_Textbook_Lessons) stating that five annotated diagram is better for teaching students about lightning than a 600-word passage. 
* Their experiment shows that having step-by-step diagrams is better than final state diagrams (one completed diagram) and text-only assembly procedures
* With increasing steps in an assembly, people following final state diagrams and text-only assembly procedures has considerably higher error, while there is a minimal error for step-to-step procedures

### 3. [Work Instructions or SOPs - Why They Help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_lO74fO3VA)

A short video that I think emphasize more on assembling line assembly procedure.

* All your various assembly instructions must be in **same** format. Meaning, there must be a clear format
* Keep your instructions short and precise
  * Since step-by-step instructions are often long (in terms of number of pages) since there is a diagram for each step. I internalise the meaning as in concise instructions.
* Write in active voice 
  * I always wondered why does it have to be active voice but my speculation is that the language of active voice such as *"Place the book on the table"* compared to a passive voice *"The book is placed on the table"* has less words to describe the same action and compels somebody to take action of the sentence.
